                <p>
                    My dedication to reaching new heights has always been a driving force in my life. My coding journey led me to Coding Dojo, where I honed my coding skills and gained new ones, all while juggling a full-time job, farm responsibilities, and time with my family. Pouring over 40 hours each week into my education was a testament to my unwavering commitment to excellence.
                    <br>
                    My fascination with web development traces back to middle school, although back then, I was set on pursuing a career in large animal vertinary medicine. Despite my career aspirations, I had always been drawn to coding, creating websites for my family's stallion and training program, as well as for my fianc√©'s excavation company. Eventually, my passion for web development took center stage, prompting me to take the leap and see where it could take me.
                    <br>
                    Beyond my professional pursuits, I'm deeply passionate about animals. My life outside of work revolves around my two horses, two mini donkeys, two cats, and a dog. I actively compete in barrel racing and contribute to our local horse community by producing horse shows and barrel races.
                    <br>
                    Additionally, I'm no stranger to the creative world. Photography has been a captivating outlet for me, with a focus on product and animal photography. My skills extend to Adobe Photoshop, a tool I've been continuing to learn.
                    <br>
                    My story is one of resilience, adaptability, and a genuine connection to the things I'm passionate about. Whether it's crafting code or capturing moments through the lens, I approach each endeavor with unwavering dedication. I'm excited to contribute my skills, experience, and enthusiasm to a dynamic team that values both hard work and a well-rounded perspective.
