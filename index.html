                <h4>Get to know me - </h4>
                <p>
                    My dedication to reaching new heights has always been a driving force in my life. My journey led me to Coding Dojo, where I honed my coding skills and gained new ones, all while juggling a full-time job, farm responsibilities, and time with my family. Pouring over 40 hours each week into my education was a testament to my unwavering commitment to excellence.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    My fascination with web development traces back to middle school, although back then, I was set on pursuing a career in large animal vertinary medicine. Despite my career aspirations, I had always been drawn to coding, creating websites for my family's stallion and training program, as well as for my fiancé's excavation company. Eventually, my passion for web development took center stage, prompting me to take the leap and see where it could take me.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Beyond my professional pursuits, I'm deeply passionate about animals. My life outside of work revolves around my two horses, two mini donkeys, two cats, and a dog. I actively compete in barrel racing and contribute to our local horse community by producing horse shows and barrel races. Recently, I've embraced a thrilling new challenge in my life by delving into desert racing alongside my fiancé. Strapping into the can-am, we navigate the rugged terrain, pushing the boundaries of speed and skill. This adrenaline-fueled pursuit has not only deepened our bond but also reinforced my belief in the power of stepping outside my comfort zone. Just as I've approached coding and web development with determination, I tackle desert racing with the same fervor, embracing the learning curve and relishing every exhilarating moment on the desert track.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Additionally, I'm no stranger to the creative world. Photography has been a captivating outlet for me, with a focus on product and animal photography. My skills extend to Adobe Photoshop, a tool I've been continuing to learn.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    My story is one of resilience, adaptability, and a genuine connection to the things I'm passionate about. Whether it's crafting code or capturing moments through the lens, I approach each endeavor with unwavering dedication. I'm excited to contribute my skills, experience, and enthusiasm to a dynamic team that values both hard work and a well-rounded perspective.
